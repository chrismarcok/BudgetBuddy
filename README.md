# BudgetBuddy for Android

BudgetBuddy is a quick and lightweight budgeting assistant for your Android Device. Create a budget and start saving money with BudgetBuddy! 
I created this app because I wanted to find an easy and comprehensible way to track my spending over a long term period while staying under a set budget.
